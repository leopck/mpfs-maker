# MPFS Maker on Javascript ported

This project is in the attempt of porting cnlohr's mpfs.c from the web folder in esp82xx project.
Porting over to Javascript on web browser.

## Status

- Pre-Alpha (Doesn't work yet)

Currently it doesn't work yet, I'm still porting to Javascript.

## Reason

In order to build codes over from the web browser instead of creating from Linux/Mac only. It's too much hassle for users when all they want is to change a few lines of codes.
